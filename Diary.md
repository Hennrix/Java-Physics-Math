# Simple Diary to keep at least my thoughts somewhere
**12.08.2024** Made A Few Java Objects, that work together to make a three Dimensional Line, 
as an Object.  
I plan to further introduce more and more Objects and Physical Principles and Mechanics.  
If I really feel gifted I might even make it visible/gui-based.  
**13.08.2024** Added A GUI for that one Line you can do
It's not even 3d, I am truly proud
